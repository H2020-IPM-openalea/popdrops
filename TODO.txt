 * To be implemented may 30, 2013: 


- produce a model that alows estimating leaching on leaf as a function of leaf geometry and incoming direction of rain
  -> get angle of geometry in g
  -> apply the model for a given incidence angle

- produce a model that estimate surface impacted by a rain/flux from surface area and debit throughthe surface (q.m-2.s-1). In the case of pesticide would need to retrieve the speed of the vehicle during the spray or duration of spray for one square  meter

- produce a model that estimate the total number of droplets per square meter splashed during a rain event using hourly meteorological data and spatialise it using projected area in the direction of rain
